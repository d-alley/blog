In the Acknowledgements section, the author read the book *The Selfish Gene* by Richard Dawkins, recommended by Charlie Munger in 2000 and his life hasn't been the same since. The book is broken down into 3 sections:
1. Avoid Big Risks
2. Buy High Quality at a Fair Price (Chapter 2 to 4 deals with *What* to buy, Chapter 5 to 7 deails with *How* to buy)
3. Don't be lazy - be *very* lazy

## Avoid Big Risks

### Chapter 1 Oh, to be a Bumblebee

>In Chapter 1, the author discussed how <ins>"betting your life"</ins> is a remarkably sound strategy for investing and how adopting this approach has led to the spectacular success of *all* living organisms over millions of years.

Type I error: do things we are not supposed to do, e.g. make a bad investment because I erroneously think it is a good one. Harm themselves.

Type II error: don't do things we are supposed to do, e.g. reject a good investment because I erroneously think it is bad. Walk away from a great opportunity.

*The risk of these two errors is inversely related.*

An overly optimistic investor who sees an upside in almost every investment will make several type I errors by committing to bad investments but also will not miss out on the few good investments.

On the other hand, an overly cautious investor who keeps finding reasons to reject every investment is likely to make very few bad investments but will lose out on some good investments

Which of the following investment strategies should you use:
1. making a lot of investments so as not to lose out on some good opportunities, as a result living with some failed investments
2. being highly selective to avoid making bad investments, thereby missing out on some good investments

Hints from evolution:

Stags found great evolutionary success by minimiing self-harm, not even attempt to duel until they have big enough antlers, refuse to engage until they believe they have more than a fair chance of winning. Only about 5% of rutting stags receive permanent injuries.

The deer make many more type II errors such as withdrawing from a rutting duel when they have a good chance of winning the harem. Lost opportunity to mate.

Plants commit resources to defending against attacks or growing. Indirect defense works on the simple principle that "my enemy's enemy is my friend".

When a plant senses an insect attack, it releases chemical compounds that attract predators of the insects attacking the plants.

Plants avoid taking risks to their life and well-being at the cost of giving up potentially juicy opportunities.

Buffett's Two Rules of Investing
1. Never lose money: don't commit to an investment in which the *probability* of losing money is higher than the probability of making money. *Risk* should be the probability of incurring a capital loss.
2. Never forget rule number 1

**A Great Investor Is a Great Rejector**

**There are very few good investments in the market.**

Minimizing Type I errors increases Success Rate much more dramatically than minimizing Type II errors, simple because there are few good investments.

**How to avoid Big Risks**
1. Be wary of Criminals, Crooks, and Cheats
2. Avoid Turnarounds: recommends IBM, Lou Gerstner's book *Who Says Elephants Can't Dance? Inside IBM's Historic Turnaround*, CEO of IBM from 1993 to 2002, stock price went up 7x from $13 to $77. Ron Johnson, credited with transforming Target and creating the iconic Apple Stores, took over JCPenny, sales dropped 25%, stock price dropped 60% during his 18 months tenure before being fired by the board in mid-2013. Predicting the fate of turnaroudn efforts even at what *appeared* at slam-dunk cases don't seem so clear cut.
3. Detesting Debt: If a company can borrow money to purchase assets, its return on equity and earnings per share should improve. Mathematically, this is undoubtedly true. Realistically, this is undoubtedly dangerous.
>What could be more important than improving short-term return on equity and earnings per share for a business:
>1. Survival. There is no point in improving return on equity by a few % if it compromises long-term survival. The 20 biggest bankruptcies in the United States, *all*, were heavily indebted. More than 90% of Nalanda's portfolio companies have excess cash and *no* leverage. Only 3 out of 30 have some debt, and the maximum debt/equity ratio among the three is 0.3.
>2. Debt diminishes strategic flexibility and hence long-term value creation.
4. Ignoring M&A Junkies: AOL an Time Warner, $350 billion merger in 2000. Within 2 years, AOL took a write-off of $99 *billion* on the deal and market value went from $226 billion in 2000 to $20 billion in 2002, acquired by Verizon for $4.4 billion in 2015. *Harvard Business Review* article by Clyton Christensen and others titled "The Big Idea: The New M&A Playbook" claims that 70 to 90% of M&A fail; KPMG study claims that 83% of merger deals did not create value. Reasons for failure include culture mismatch, overpayment, misevaluation of the opportunity, external factors, and integration problems, among many others. Singple biggest reason Nalanda detest M&A: *opportunity cost*
>What Bayer missed doing by making a gargantuan acquisition of Monsanto:
>1. divestiture of attractive business
>2. reduced focus on existing businesses
>3. missed opportunities
5. Not Predicting Where the Puck Will be: 546 IPOs successfully raised $69 billion in 1999 alone but *very* few companies have created truly significant value from the dot-com era, such as Amazon, Google, eBay and Priceline (now called Booking Holdings).
6. Not Aligning with Unaligned Owners: Nalanda want the company owner to align their interest with the shareholders'. one and only one objective as a shareholder of any business is *long-term value creation*. The company must do this in an ethical, sustainable manner that is fair to all stakeholders, including employees, vendors, suppliers, and customers.
>Three broad categories of owners that Nalanda avoid to mitigate Type I risk:
>1. Government-owned businesses: The government wants to achieve multiple objectives with their businesses, some of which have nothing to do with enhancing value and profits. The skill required to run a company successfully in a competitive environment is not the same as that needed to manage a district or devise a sound social policy for a state.
>2. Listed subsidiaries of global giants: they are more interested in the value creation of the *parent*, not the Indian-listed child. Best managers in MNCs are sent tto the privately held *separate* fully owned subsidiary, not the listed subsidiary that the Indian government forced them to list.
>3. Indian conglomerates: value creation is possible only through sustained focus. How does one achieve excellence in multiple entities across entirely different industries?

**At Nalanda, shortlist comprises 75 to 80 companies out of a universe of about 800 with a market value of more than $100 million.**

## Buy High Quality at a Fair Price

### Chapter 2 The Siberian Solution

*An economic franchise arises from a product or service that (1) is needed or desired; (2) is thought by its customers to have no close substitute; and (3) is not subject to price regulation. The existence of all three conditions will be demonstrated by a company's ability to regularly price its product or service aggressively and thereby to earn high rates of return on capital. Moreoever, franchises can tolerate mismanagement. Inept managers may diminish a franchise's profitability, but they cannot inflict mortal damage.* - Warren Buffett, 1991

Two-step approach at Nalanda:
1. use *one* selection criterion that filters out low-quality or average-quality businesses and yields a premliminary list of high-quality companies.
2. Do more work on this preliminary list to further whittle it down to a final list.

>Investable universe: 800 Indian businesses (with a market value of more than $150 million)
>Reject close to 350 companies to minimize the risks outlined in Section 1.
>About 450 businesses remain. Then apply a *single* filter "F" to cut down this list to about 150 firms.
>F simply gives the preliminary list on which work needs to be done to further reject or choose businesses.
>Final list has only about 75 to 80 businesses.

What is F?
1. It should be easily measurable
2. It should remove most, if not all, low-quality businesses
3. It should select most, if not all, high-quality businesses

Guesses for F:
1. Management: when someone says, "This is a great management team," what they are *actually* saying is, "These guys talk so well!" The "great management team" filter fails the first criterion of measurability (being easily measurable)
2. Revenue growth: problem is how do we know what went *into* achieving this growth? most internet businesses were growing fast during the dot-com bust. They ignored the cost of growth and suffered for it.
3. Margins: Gross margin doesn't tell us anythign about the *quality* of business. EBITDA or EBIT margin can't distinguish a good business Costco (3% operating margin) vs Tiffany & Co. (19% operating margin) and fails to filter fo the second *and* third criteria.
4. Macro factors: if inflation is picked as the macro factor, do you compeltely revise the list if the inflation expectations get reversed wtihin 6 months?

Dmitri Belyaev wanted to answer 2 questions:
1. How had the domestication of animals (e.g., dogs, pigs, goats, and cows) started, and
2. Why did most domestic animals have similar characteristics, including floppy ears, curly tails, a piebald coloration (patches of black and white), and babyish faces?

**What was being selected?**

Dmitri hypothecized that the key facor selected when our ancestors domesticated wild animals was *tameness*. Lyudmila Trut bred wild foxes by selecting a few of the calmest Class I (friendliest and seemed to want to engage with the handlers) foxes for mating. The 8th generation started displaying novel *physical* traits in coat color with a piebald pattern, floppy ears and rolled tails. Lyudmila lived with a fox and it starts showing guard-dog-like behavior, rushing to protect a human from a potential threat.

This single filter of a *behavioral* characteristic had triggered many *physical* changes in the animals. How could this have happened?

When a dog owner stares lovingly into their canine's eyes, oxytocin is released int he systems of both the dog and the owner, creating a positive feedback loop in whcih the two enjoy each other's company more and more. Although it's the same gene in question, the gene expression is different in different situations. Scientists have demonstrated that gene expression needs to change only a little to have a significant impact on an animal's body and behavior.

Lyudmila's selection of tamer foxes alttered the amount and timing of release of certain neurochemicals and hormones that regulated the developmental and physical traits of the foxes.

>Darwin predicted that if humans choose to select for one characteristic, they will surely also cause transformations in other characteristics owing to what he called the "mysterious laws of the correlation of growth".

**At Nalanda, they *begin* with *historical* return on capital employed (ROCE) while short-listing businesses.**

**ROCE = EBIT / (Net Working Capital + Net Fixed Assets)**

Exclude excess cash (i.e., cash minus debt if cash happens to be much greater than debt) in Net Working Capital because extra cash is not an operating asset.

For an acquisitive company, include the capital invested in acquiring businesses.

The advantage of measuring ROCE is that it accounts for the quality of P&L (in the numerator) as well as the balance sheet (in the denominator).

**A Consistently High-ROCE Business Is Likely to Be Run by an Excellent Management Team**

The *only* indicator of the *quality* of the management team is their historical track record on the *quantity* of ROCE.

SUstaining high ROSE in *any* industry over *any* length of time is extraordinarily hard.

The median historical ROCE of Nalanda's portfolio of 30 businesses - most of which are more than 35 to 40 years old - is about 42%.

**A Consistently High ROCE Business Is Likely to Have a Strong Competitive Advantage**

Just having a brand means nothing. A sustained high ROCE is a good *starting* point to conclude that the company may have *some* kind of competitive advantage.

**A Consistently High-ROCE Business Allocates Capital Well**

Great businessess try to earn the maximum operating profit per unit of capital deployed.

Nalanda assumes that a company with high ROCE is, *on average*, deploying its capital well.

**A Consistently High-ROCE Business Allows Companies to Take Busienss RIsk Without Taking FInancial Risk, Which Increases the Chance of Business Success.**

Capitalism thrives on risk-taking. Most companies thrive in the Goldilocks zone of *calculated* risk-taking. High ROCE allows a comapny to keep taking calculated business risks.

A company delivery high ROCE with modest revenue growth will generate excess cash. This allows a company to withstand short-term pain to achieve longer-term goals.

Nalanda rejects companies with long-term historical ROCE lower than 20%.

### Chapter 3 The Paradox of Mckinsey and Sea Urchins

Marvin Bower joined McKinsey in 1933 and transformed the small engineering and accounting firm into the management consulting powerhouse it is today. It used to serve mostly manufacturers in its early days, but now it's all over Google, Facebook, or a hot new start-up in the Valley.

Ask the question "How do we change faster, better, and easier?" or "How do we change *without* changing?"

**The Genetic Code Is Robust**: It funneled down 64 possibilities to just 20 through synonymous mutation. Any of the 4 nucleotides (A, C, U, G) can occupy one o the 3 bases, 64 possible amino acids (4 x 4 x 4). Two or more codons can code for the *same* amino acid. For instance, GGU, GGC, GGA, and GGG are all glycine. The formation of glycine is thus highly robust to mutations on the 3rd base.

**Proteins are Robust**
1. Function of proteins is unaffected by the vast majority of amino acid changes. B-lactamse protein has 263 amino acids, 84% of which can experience mutation *without* changing the enzyme's basic function.
2. Proteins with similar functions and structures can be made from different amino acid sequences. E.g. the three-dimensional structure of whale myoglobin and clam hemoglobin can be almost perfectly superimposed despite only 18% of their amino acids overlap.
3. Vast majority of amino acid sequences fold into very few structures. Protein structure with 100 amino acids has possible protein fold of 20^100. However, only about 20^3 proteins exist.

**The Body is Robust**: Two species of sea urchins T and E diverged about 5 million years ago (almost the same time chimpanzees and humans diverged). T produces larvae that bear no physical resemblance to the adult, E develops *directly* from an egg with no larval stage in between. However, they maintained their body plans and look almost the same.

**The Evolution of Evolvability** In 1968, Japanese geneticist Motoo Kimura proposed that most mutations are *neutral*, while causes robustness in the organism. While a neutral change does not alter the *primary* function, it can alter a *secondary* function, thereby becoming the source of a *future* innovation.

This is what we seek as owners of businesses: the ability to keep evolving while staying robust.

**Businesses Must Be Robust to Evolve**

Many factors contributing to robustness are qualitative.

|**Most robust**|**Least robust**|
|---|---|
|Has delivered high historical ROCE over a long period|Has made operating losses for most or all of its history|
|Has a fragmented customer base|Is dependent on very few customers|
|Has no debt and has excess cash|Is highly leveraged|
|Has built high competitive barriers|Has been unable to keep competition away|
|Has a fragmented supplier base|Is dependent on a few suppliers|
|Has a stable management team|Management turnover is high|
|Industry is slow changing|Industry is evolving fast|

Prasad hasn't figured out a reliable way in *advance* to directly assess a company's propensity to adapt to a changing world. But there is an indirect - and he would argue a reasonably reliable - path of satisfying his need. **If a company's growth is lower than its ROCE, it will also keep generating free cash flow.** The greater the robustness, the greater the evolvability.

**LUCA** our last universal common ancestor from 3.5 billion years ago, had ruvustness at multiple levels: genes, proteins, body plan. Prasad discovered from his two decades of investment that *more* levels of robustness lead to *more* evolvability.

**Highly Robust Businesses Evolve by Taking Calculated Risks**

The company that best demonstrates calculated aggression and risk-taking is **Walmart**. Store openings and selling more products through the same stores propelled growth from 1967 to 1980. Sales per store during these 13 years increased about 7x. One of his experiments, Sam's Club, was launched in 1983 and within a decade crossed revenue of $10 billion. Walmart managed acquisitions by keeping targets small and manageable and funded them without taking on large debt.

**Robustness Is a Proxy for Evolutionary and Business Success but Doesn't Guarantee it**

The cataclysmic aftermath of an asteroid stike in the Yucatan peninsula 65 million years ago wiped out the dinosaurs, but the mammals survived, no one is sury why. The extraordinary robustness of dinosaurs did not guarantee their evolvability.

A business can lose its robustness. A comapny's excessive focus on robustness may compromise growth.

**The *Only* Way to Protect Against Loss of Robustness Is Entry Valuation**

The median TTM entry PE ratio for the Nalanda portfolio is 14.9 vs 19.7 for Sensex from 2005 to 2020, vs 23.8 for Midcap Index. They buy exceptional businesses at 25% to 30% discount on the index.

**A Leader is Made a Loser** Toys "R" Us didn't respond well to Amazon and was servicing $400 million a year in debt resulting from the LBO by KKR and Bain.

### Chapter 4 The Perils of a Pavlovian

Bateman's principle, named after an English geneticist, argues for the prevalence of polygyny in the animal kingdom: since females invest much more in offspring than do males, they are the limiting factor over which males compete, leading to polygyny. However, polyandry is more widspread than Bateman believed and one of these species is mite N. californicus.

The ultimate cause of polyandry consists of both direct and indirect fitness benefits:
1. Ultimate cause: Females that mated multiple times produced more offspring than females that mated just once, and these offspring also survived longer.
2. Proximate cuase: If the females' firs mating period was below 150 minutes, the likelihood of their continuing to seek male partners increased. The immediate cause of females seeking more sex was a lack of sex.

*Recognizing* the difference between **proximate** and **ultimate** causes is on top of all philosophical issues from evolutionary biology.

The **ultimate** success of an investment is almost entirely dependent on the **ultimate** success of the business.

The interesting thing about proximate causes ist hat they are almost always evident in screaming newspaper headlines and hyperventilating news anchors. **Ultimate causes, *thankfully*, are way too dull for media coverage.**

**Proximate** causes of share price gyrations:
1. Macroeconomic: economists failed to predict 148 of the last 150 recessions. Even big macro events (like the Asian financial crisis) are uncorrelated with longer-term stock price performance. Using proximate economic data to assess industry and company performance is very hard, if not impossible. No one knows anything.
2. Market-related: John Maynard Keynes abandoned trying to guess what the average opinion expects the average winner to be, abandoned detailed economic model to predict market levels and switched to picking stocks and eschewed diversification. "The right method of investment is to put fairly large sums of money into enterprises one thinks one knows something about."
3. Thematic: thematic investing is seductive as investors get hyped up by TAM which is simple to understand and is actionable. Even though TAM is pointless because it does not tell us whether any *profits* will be made.
4. Company-specific factors: dilemma is much trickier to address when the proximate cause of problems relates to the company itself. **Developing a method and an instinct to separate proximate and ultimate causes of failure or success when they relate to a *company* event is invaluable for a long-term investor.** If the decline results from a loss of market share for three years in a row, ask if there is something fundamentally wrong with the business.

Ultimate causes are way too dull for media coverage: Researchers showed that subjects remembered negative words faster and more often than positive ones and the media exploits this existing prejudice. In times of crisis, wonderful businesses were finally available at a price Nalanda could not refuse.

### Chapter 5 Darwin Ate My DCF

Prasad believes that the continued underperformance of fund managers is their focus on *future* rewards while ignoring the treasures of the *past*.

Darwin adopted *Uniformitarianism* as a guiding principle of his evolutionary theory, which claims that all significant changes on Earth result from slow and steady natural processes operating over millions of years. His groundbreaking book *On the Origin of Species*, his focus on *historical* information to make deductions about *ongoing* evolutionary processes was made evident. He proposed *three* revolutionary theories:
1. Natural Selection
>Natural Selection requires three key ingredients:
>1. random variation among the progeny of an organism
>2. differntial fitness among these variants such that injurious variations get rejected and favorable ones are preserved
>3. favorable traits must be heritable so that they are passed on to the next generation

"Slow though the process of selection may be if a feeble man can do much by his powers of artificial selection, I can see no limit to the amount of change, to the infinite beauty and infinite complexity of the coadaptations between all organic beings, one with another and with their physical conditions of life, which may be affected in the long course of tiem by nature's power of selection."

2. Sexual Selection: it was teh peahens who arbitrarily decided the aesthetics of a tail.
3. Common Ancestry: most species have evolved from very few common ancestors, "descent with modification". Early-stage embroys of seemingly unrelated groups like mammals, birds and reptiles resemble one another so closely that it is hard to distinguish between them.

**Darwin had the same historical facts as everyone else. It was only his *interpretations* that were radically new and different.**

"Strategy" is "whatever companies do to achieve thei goals under conditions of uncertainty." Assessing *historical* strategies to understand business:
- Which customer segments have ou targeted?
- How have your products or services served the needs of customers?
- In what ways have you been different from the competition?
- How have you allocated capital historically?
- What has been your capital structure, and why?
Prasad ask these questions not to evaluate the answers objectively, but to subjectively assess if they fit their *preexisting hypotheses* of success or failure.

**Assessing the strategy of a business is useless unless we have a strategy to comprehend the strategy.**

Bias to reject almost every automotive component business as its clients do not allow them to make money. In the U.S., top 5 car companies controlled about 2/3 fo the market in 2021. In India, Maruti Suzuki controlls 50% of the Indian market. The Indian motorcycle market is an oligopoly of just 3 companies.

Exception: NRB Bearings, CEO Harshbeena Zaveri, an anthropology graduate from Wellesly, best strategic thinker in Nalanda's portfolio
1. The parts supplier would need to manufacture a critical component requiring proprietary technology
2. Have a low customer concentration over many years
3. Have only one or two competitors, and the competitive dynamics inthe industry should be stable over the long term
4. Should have been no new entrants to the industry for many years
5. The company should have delivered good financials historically

"Better" relates to measurable parameters like ROCE, market share, free cash flow, balance sheet strength, consistency of financials, and other such measures.

Prasad wants their businesses to gain market share over the long term, recognizing full well that the trend line may occasionally reverse in the short term.

**There is almost nothign better than measuring market share of volume, revenue, and profit over a long period.**

**Assigning Value to a Business**

The *only* PE ratio Nalanda discuss relates to the devliered earnings of the past. It may be the previous 12 months or the past 3 years, or, for some highly cyclical businesses, even teh past 10 year average PE (i.e. current market value divided by the average earnings of the past 10 years).

There are 2 main requirements for building a DCF spreadsheet: discount rate and cash flow projection. Both are close to impossible to forecast with precision.

Risk comes first, quality second, and valuation last.

History can teach us less about who *they* were and much more about who *we* are.

As long-term investors, Prasad disassociated themselves from the "what will happen?" obsession and replaced it with "what has *actually* happened?". What matters is the *opinions* they build onto those facts, but at least they give them a foundation for discussion.

### Chapter 6 Bacteria and Business Replay the Tape

**Convergence Is Ubiquitous**

Australia, a nation of only 25 million people won 547 medals in the Summer Olympics (before Tokyo 2000), exceeding many nations much more significant in population. Australia was part of the supercontinent Pangea and its southern segment Gondwanaland, which started breaking apart about 180 million years ago. As a result, Australia has been a free-stnading continent for about 35 million years. The mammals on this massive island have been taking a unique evolutionary path during the time.
