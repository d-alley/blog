In the Preface, the author describes his early fascination with contemplating all kinds of problems. He was drawn to Physics and Mathematics (especially Trigonometry) for their ability to explain the complex world using simple formulas and language. During the open exam for high school students in China, his sole aspiration was to be accepted into a Physics program in college.

When he first encountered the Second Law of Thermodynamics, which states that entropy always increases, he was struck by a profound sense of loneliness and despair. The notion that energy inevitably dissipates into disorder and decay made him question the purpose of existence. If the universe is destined for chaos and the end of life, what is the meaning of it all? What makes his life meaningful?

Karl Popper’s scientific theories had a profound impact on him. While science alone cannot answer questions of meaning, Scientific Philosophy—rooted in scientific principles—might offer some insights. Using science to understand the world and the relationship between individuals and society opened up a new realm of exploration for him. At the time, he was preoccupied with a question that had haunted Chinese intellectuals for over a century: Why is the West leading the world? Why has China lagged so far behind? And, most crucially, can China catch up, and if so, how?

He arrived in the United States in the late 1980s and began his academic journey at Columbia University. The Core Curriculum required all students to engage deeply with the foundations of Western Civilization, studying over a hundred classic works spanning several thousand years, including The Iliad, Greek Philosophy and Drama, Medieval Philosophy, the Renaissance, the Enlightenment, and the Modern Scientific Revolution. This period sparked an immense passion and curiosity in him, igniting a lifelong quest for knowledge. Columbia also offered alternative courses on Confucian Civilization and Islamic Civilization, which allowed him to revisit Chinese history, albeit through the lens of the English language. These formative years at Columbia were crucial in shaping his intellectual framework.

He had always been a seeker of knowledge, but at the time, he had no clear sense of what kind of knowledge could change his own fate or impact society. Then he stumbled upon a lecture by Warren Buffett and realized that through hard work and diligent research, one could analyze a company’s fundamentals, gain insights, and predict its future performance—ultimately leading to the accumulation of wealth. It has been 26 years since he bought his first stock. That experience taught him that there is indeed a wealth of opportunity in books and that knowledge possesses endless potential for application.

At the start of his career, he was not entirely satisfied with simply investing in securities. He always wanted to build companies. This led him to venture investing, where he helped several startups grow from zero to one, watching them expand and flourish. This was yet another fascinating chapter in his journey.
