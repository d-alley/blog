In the Acknowledgements section, the author read the book *The Selfish Gene* by Richard Dawkins, recommended by Charlie Munger in 2000 and his life hasn't been the same since. The book is broken down into 3 sections:
1. Avoid Big Risks
2. Buy High Quality at a Fair Price
3. Don't be lazy - be *very* lazy

>In Chapter 1, the author discussed how **"betting your life"** is a remarkably sound strategy for investing and how adopting this approach has led to the spectacular success of *all* living organisms over millions of years.

Type I error: do things we are not supposed to do, e.g. make a bad investment because I erroneously think it is a good one. Harm themselves.

Type II error: don't do things we are supposed to do, e.g. reject a good investment because I erroneously think it is bad. Walk away from a great opportunity.

*The risk of these two errors is inversely related.*

An overly optimistic investor who sees an upside in almost every investment will make several type I errors by committing to bad investments but also will not miss out on the few good investments.

On the other hand, an overly cautious investor who keeps finding reasons to reject every investment is likely to make very few bad investments but will lose out on some good investments

Which of the following investment strategies should you use:
1. making a lot of investments so as not to lose out on some good opportunities, as a result living with some failed investments
2. being highly selective to avoid making bad investments, thereby missing out on some good investments

Hints from evolution:

Stags found great evolutionary success by minimiing self-harm, not even attempt to duel until they have big enough antlers, refuse to engage until they believe they have more than a fair chance of winning. Only about 5% of rutting stags receive permanent injuries.

The deer make many more type II errors such as withdrawing from a rutting duel when they have a good chance of winning the harem. Lost opportunity to mate.

Plants commit resources to defending against attacks or growing. Indirect defense works on the simple principle that "my enemy's enemy is my friend".

When a plant senses an insect attack, it releases chemical compounds that attract predators of the insects attacking the plants.

Plants avoid taking risks to their life and well-being at the cost of giving up potentially juicy opportunities.

Buffett's Two Rules of Investing
1. Never lose money: don't commit to an investment in which the *probability* of losing money is higher than the probability of making money. *Risk* should be the probability of incurring a capital loss.
2. Never forget rule number 1

**A Great Investor Is a Great Rejector**

*There are very few good investments in the market.*

Minimizing Type I errors increases Success Rate much more dramatically than minimizing Type II errors, simple because there are few good investments.

**How to avoid Big Risks**
1. Be wary of Criminals, Crooks, and Cheats
2. Avoid Turnarounds: recommends IBM, Lou Gerstner's book *Who Says Elephants Can't Dance? Inside IBM's Historic Turnaround*, CEO of IBM from 1993 to 2002, stock price went up 7x from $13 to $77. Ron Johnson, credited with transforming Target and creating the iconic Apple Stores, took over JCPenny, sales dropped 25%, stock price dropped 60% during his 18 months tenure before being fired by the board in mid-2013. Predicting the fate of turnaroudn efforts even at what *appeared* at slam-dunk cases don't seem so clear cut.
3. Detesting Debt: If a company can borrow money to purchase assets, its return on equity and earnings per share should improve. Mathematically, this is undoubtedly true. Realistically, this is undoubtedly dangerous.
* What could be more important than improving short-term return on equity and earnings per share for a business:
* 1. Survival. There is no point in improving return on equity by a few % if it compromises long-term survival. The 20 biggest bankruptcies in the United States, *all*, were heavily indebted. More than 90% of Nalanda's portfolio companies have excess cash and *no* leverage. Only 3 out of 30 have some debt, and the maximum debt/equity ratio among the three is 0.3.
* 3. **Debt diminishes strategic flexibility and hence long-term value creation.**
4. Ignoring M&A Junkies
5. Not Predicting Where the Puck Will be
6. Not Aligning with Unaligned Owners
