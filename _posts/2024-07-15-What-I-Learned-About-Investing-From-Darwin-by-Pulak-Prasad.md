In the Acknowledgements section, the author read the book *The Selfish Gene* by Richard Dawkins, recommended by Charlie Munger in 2000 and his life hasn't been the same since. The book is broken down into 3 sections:
1. Avoid Big Risks
2. Buy High Quality at a Fair Price
3. Don't be lazy - be *very* lazy

>In Chapter 1, the author discussed how **"betting your life"** is a remarkably sound strategy for investing and how adopting this approach has led to the spectacular success of *all* living organisms over millions of years.
