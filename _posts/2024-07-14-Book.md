>**Key Takeaway from this book:**
>
>A good investor analyses the company's long-term earning power and management's ability to keep the course. Any actions that dilutes the company's look-through earnings, or the overall look-through earnings of a portfolio, destroys value. The instinct to invest and the number sense requires reading about the company and the environment it operates in day after day, across a substantial period of time, so that there's a backdrop against which you can form informed perspectives on the relative proabilitiy of success of the company.

The Preface to the book was written in February 1999, where the author stated that the book is meant to be a companion to "The Warren Buffett Way" and emphasises two important areas: *structure* and *cognition*. He mentioned that Warren Buffett believes that it is very important to have a fundamental grasp of mathematics and probabilities, and that investors should understand the psychology of the market.

**Is it a Good Investment?**

1. Certainty that the long-term economic characteristics of the business can be evaluated
2. Certainty that management has the ability to fully realize the potential of the business and to wisely employ its cash flows
3. Certainty that managmeent can be counted on to channel the rewards to the shareholders
4. Purchase Price

**Why is efficient market theory not defensible?**

1. Investors are not always rational
2. Investors do not process information correctly
3. Performance yardsticks emphasize short-term performance
Buffett's problem with efficient market theory rests on one central point: it makes no provision for investors who analyze all the available information and gain a competitive advantage by doing so.

**New Portfolio Theory**

1. Market is not always efficient, investors willing to stud and learn are given opportunities to beat the market
2. Risk is not price-based; it is economic-value-based.
3. Optimal portfolio is a focus portfolio wthat stresses big bets on high-probability events

National coin-flipping contest where 225 million Americans bet $1 on their guess

After 10 events, 220,000 winners are left, would have gained $1,024

After another 10 tosses, 215 winners, each with $1 million

Whenever a high concentration of anything occurs in one specific area, something unusual may be going on at that spot, and bears investigation.

The members of this one unique group are defined not by where they live but by whom they learned from.

**John Maynard Keynes' Chest Fund:**

1. Careful selection of a few investors having regards to their cheapness in relation to their probable actual and potential intrinsic value over a period of years ahead and in relation to alternative investments at the time;
2. Steadfast holding of fiarly large units through thick and thin until they fulfilled their promise or it is evident that they were purchased on a mistake;
3. Balanced investment position, and if possible opposed risks.

> In my opinion Chapter 4 is the most important chapter in the book as it suggests a better way to measure performance. How a weak stock could dilute returns of a portfolio and the job of the manager is to improve the rate of return by picking a few focused high quality companies.

**Buffett + Munger**

Look-through earnings - operating earnings of its consolidated businesses (its subsidiaries), retained earnings of its large common stock investments, allowance for tax if the retained earnings were actually paid out.

The goal of each investor should be to create a portfolio (in effect a 'company') that will deliver him/her the highest possible look-through earnigns a decade or so from now.

First looks at what he already own, to see whether the new purchase is any better. If the new thing isn't better than what you already know is available, then it hasn't met your threshold. This screens out 99% of what you see.

When you buy or sell a company in your portfolio, you have either raised or lowered your economic benchmark.

The job of a portfolio manager, who is a long-term owner of securities and beleives future stock prices eventually match with underlying economics, is to find ways to raise the  benchmark.

The job of manager, is not to find ways to make the train longer but to find ways to make it run faster.

If you own a lousy company, you requre turnover because without it, you end up owning, for a long term, the economics of a sub-par business.

To suggest that investor should sell off portions of his most successful investments simply because they have come to dominate his portfolio is akin to suggesting that the Bulls trade Michael Jordan because he has become so important to the team.

**Warren Buffett Tools**

In a low-interest-rate environment, he adjusts the discount rate upward. When bond yields dipped below 7%, Buffett adjusted his discount rate up to 10%.

Buffett measures a company's hurdle rate by its ability to grow its market value by a rate that is at least equal to the value of the company's retained earnings. For every dollar a company retains, it should create at least one dollar in market value.

Buffett rejects the EVA model as the cost of capital actualy declines when the relative use of debt increases. He has a liking for companies that are debt free or close to it, EVA suggestion that higher debt is a good thing because it equals lower cost of capital doesn't make sense.

Buffett generally charge people ~15% on capital. They find that 15% gets their attention, but shouldn't be such a high hurdle rate ethat things they want to do don't get done.

If a company generates high returns on equity, the duty of management is to reinvest those earnings back into the comapny, for the benefit of shareholders. However, if the earnings cannot be reinvested at high rates, management has three options:
(1) ignore the problema dn continue to reinvest at below-average rates;
(2) buy growth;
(3) return the money to shareholders. (only this choice is rational)

The choice that management makes will prove either valuable or disappointing for shareholders long before the results are compiled in an annual report.

There is something admirable about the manager who, with courage, discusses the failures of the company with shareholders. A manager who confesses mistakes publicly is more likely to correct them.

If allocation of capital is simple and logical, why is capital so poorly allocated?

*insititutional imperative* - the lemming-like tendency of corporate management to imitate the behavior of other managers, no matter how silly or irrational it may be.

**Buffett's tips:**

1. Paying special attention to what management said then about strategies for the future
2. Compare those plans to today's results
3. Compare the strategies of a few years ago to this year's strategies and ideas
4. Compare the annual reports fo the company you are interested in with reports from similar companies in the same industry

**Management => Financials => Asking Price (in that order)**

Bill Miller studies philosophy at John Hopkins Graduate School, read William James' Pragmatism and John Dewey's Essays in Experimental Logic, manages the Value Trust at Legg Mason.

Runs a very low turnover strategy, very concentrated portfolio compared to other equity funds. His method of valuing companies is similar to Buffett in that they both look at free cash flow as a measure of intrinsic value.


Buffett admires most:
- High profit margins
- High returns on capital
- Ability to reinvest profits back into a fast growing company
- Management acts in the interests of shareholders


In his consumer products world:
- Brand awareness
- Pricing power
- Share of mind

are all factors included in an franchise


In the technology wold, franchise factors are:
- network effects
- Positive feedback
- Lock-in
- Increasing returns

**Mathematics of Investing**

Buffett read Richard Feynman's autobiography "Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman", where he describes his technique for doing complex math in his head.

Buffett either:
1. remembers eerything he reads or 
2. can do calculations with lightning speed

For example:
99 times 99? 9,801
$250 to $50 million in 100 years, what's the annual rate of return? 13%. To go by the number of times it doubles ($250 doubles about 17.6 times to get to $50 million, a double every 5.7 years, or about 13% a year)

Fermat used algebra whereas Pascal turned to geometry

Bayesian inference: Bayesian analysis is an attempt to incorporate all available information into a process for making inferences, or decisions, about the underlying state of nature.

Harvard Business School teaches decision tree theory, all they do is take high school algebra and apply it to real-life problems.

**Risk Arbitrage is something Buffett has been doing for 40 years.**

>Kelly Optimization Model: 2p - 1 = x

Because the relationship in the Kelly model is parabolic, the penalty for underbetting is not severe. A half-Kelly, which reduces the amount of the bet by 50%, reduces the potential growth rate by only 25%.
1. First be willing to think about buying stocks in terms of probabilities
2. Be willing to play the game long enough to achieve its rewards
3. Avoid using leverage
4. Demand a margin of safety with each bet you make

To succeed in investing or in writing insurance, **"You have to wait for the fat pitch."**

What you do is start with historical data and then you make certain projections from that. It's a very subjective art form.

The focus portfolio will have a low frequency of failure, but when failure does occur it will be severe. The portfolio will take a larger-than-normal hit.

A pari-mutuel system is a market. Everybody goes there and bets and the odds are changed based on what's bet. That's what happens in the stock market.

It appears to Charlie that the most sensible way to approach horse racing or the stock market is to lie back and wait until the good horse comes tot he post with the inviting odds.

Prime bets are reserved for serious plays when:
1. confidence in the horse's ability to win is high; and
2. payoff odds are greater than they should be
3. 
Action bets: reserved for the long shots and hunches that satisfy the psychological need to play

The wise ones bet heabily when the world offers them that opportunity. They bet big when they have the odds. And the rest of the time, they don't. It's just that simple.

**Graham's view:**

An investor's appropriate reaction to a downturn is the same as business owner's response when offerred an unattractive price: ignore it.

**Munger:**

Two step analysis in making investment decisions:
1. consider rational expectations and probabilities
2. carefully evaluate the psychological factors

Investors feel twice as bad about losing money as they feel good about picking a winner. Consumers typically increase their purchases by an extra 3.5 cents for every $1 of wealth creation. But during economic slides, consumers will actually reduce their spending by almost 2x (6 cents) that amount for every $1 lost in the market. By not selling our losers, we never have to confront our failures.

One further reason why people don't sell stocks that are doing badly; in their minds, the loss doens't become real until it is acted on.

We are far more likely to take risks with found money.

Two personality characteristics closely related to risk tolerance:
1. Personal control orientation - refers to people's sense that they can affect both their environmetn and decisions about their life made within this environment, "internals". In contrast, "externals" see themselves as having little control; as being like a leaf blown hither and yon by uncontrollable winds. People who have a high propensity for taking risk were overwhelmingly classified as internals.
2. Achievement motivation - the degree to which people are goal-oriented. Risk takers are also goal-orientated, even though a strong focus on goals may lead to sharp disappointments.

**The Market as a Complex Adaptive System**

1. An economy is a network system of many "agents" all acting in parallel. Agents are people.
2. Control of economy is highly dispersed. The overall economy is often a result of the millions of decisions made by individuals (agents) each day. The coherent behavior within the economic system arises out of the compeition of cooperation among the agents.
3. Agents in a complex system accumulate experience and adapt to a changing environment.

**Buffett:**

Your goal as an investor should be simply to purchase, at a rational price, a part interest in an easily understandable business whose earnings are virtually certain to be materially higher, 5, 10, and 20 years from now. Oeveer time, you will find only a few companies that meet these standards - so when you see one that qualifies, you should buy a meaningful amount of stock.

I wouldn't want to buy anything where I wouldn't want to put 10% of my net worth into it. If I don't want to put that into it, then it just isn't much of an idea.

85% of available diversification is achieved with a 15 stock portfolio and increases to 95% with a 30 stock portfolio.

In an economic-based model, it is understood that owning fewer stocks, as opposed to more, works to reduce the overall economic risk of the portfolio.

Volatility, in an economic-based model, is good because it gives you an opportunity to buy more shares of great businesses at attractive prices.

In an economic-based model, you are comforted int he knowledge that future share prices of stocks correlate strongly to the underlying economics of the business.

If the economics of the business improve, the share price will likely rise.

If the economics of the business deteriorate, the future price of your business can be expected to fall.

In this framework, you have a winner's advantage, a method with a high probability of success.

Focus investors can measure the progress of their portfolio by calculating the look-through earnings To calculate the total earning power of your companies, multiply the earnings per share by the number of shares you own. The goal of the business owner is to create a portfolio of companies that, in 10 years, will produce the highest level of look-through earnings.

**Buffett's favorite book on bridge: Why You Lose at Bridge, by S.J. Simon**

*In the Science of Hitting*, Ted Williams explained his technique. He divided the strike zone into 77 cells, each representing the size of a baseball. Singing only at balls in his 'best' cell. Throughout your life, you get to make only 20 investment choices. This would force you to look only for the best investment opportunities.

Cocktail conversation about the future direction of markets and interest rates will be far less profitable than spending 30 minutes reading the latest communication provided by the company you own.

Peter Kuhn in *The Structure of Scientific Revolutions*, says that the first step in a paradigm shift occurs when an anomaly is introduced.

Buffett found the word 'anomaly'interesting because Columbus was an anomaly, at least for a while. What it means is something that academicians can't explain. And rather than reexamine their theories, they simply discard any evidence of that sort as anomalous.

Having invested so deeply in an education and business that preach the current model, the idea of accepting a pradigm shift is an intellectual, emotional, and financil risk not worth taking. 

Historically, when paradigm shifts do occur, they stretch over many decades and involve multiple generations, which allows ample time to educate new proponents.

Speculators had always been a part of the stock market. What troubled Graham deeply was his beilief that investors had unknowingly acquired speculative habits.

**Knowledge is what defines the difference between investment and speculation.**

In the end, the greater your level of knowledge, the less likely that pure speculation will dominate your thinking and your actions.

*Financial systems reflect the values of societies.* - finanical writer Ron Chernow

One way to stop the vicious cycle of falling back into destriuctive habits is to educate ourselves about what works and what does not.

Charlie believes in the discipline of mastering the best that other people have figured out. He doens't believe in just sitting down and trying to dream it all up yourself. Nobody's that smart.

What's really astounding is how resistant some people are to learning anything even when it's in their self-interest to learn. THere is just an incredible resistance to thinking or changing.

*"Most men would rather die than think. Many have."* -Bertrand Russell
