In the Preface, the author describes his early fascination with contemplating all kinds of problems. He was drawn to Physics and Mathematics (especially Trigonometry) for their ability to explain the complex world using simple formulas and language. During the open exam for high school students in China, his sole aspiration was to be accepted into a Physics program in college.

When he first encountered the Second Law of Thermodynamics, which states that entropy always increases, he was struck by a profound sense of loneliness and despair. The notion that energy inevitably dissipates into disorder and decay made him question the purpose of existence. If the universe is destined for chaos and the end of life, what is the meaning of it all? What makes his life meaningful?

Karl Popper’s scientific theories had a profound impact on him. While science alone cannot answer questions of meaning, Scientific Philosophy—rooted in scientific principles—might offer some insights. Using science to understand the world and the relationship between individuals and society opened up a new realm of exploration for him. At the time, he was preoccupied with a question that had haunted Chinese intellectuals for over a century: Why is the West leading the world? Why has China lagged so far behind? And, most crucially, can China catch up, and if so, how?

He arrived in the United States in the late 1980s and began his academic journey at Columbia University. The Core Curriculum required all students to engage deeply with the foundations of Western Civilization, studying over a hundred classic works spanning several thousand years, including The Iliad, Greek Philosophy and Drama, Medieval Philosophy, the Renaissance, the Enlightenment, and the Modern Scientific Revolution. This period sparked an immense passion and curiosity in him, igniting a lifelong quest for knowledge. Columbia also offered alternative courses on Confucian Civilization and Islamic Civilization, which allowed him to revisit Chinese history, albeit through the lens of the English language. These formative years at Columbia were crucial in shaping his intellectual framework.

He had always been a seeker of knowledge, but at the time, he had no clear sense of what kind of knowledge could change his own fate or impact society. Then he stumbled upon a lecture by Warren Buffett and realized that through hard work and diligent research, one could analyze a company’s fundamentals, gain insights, and predict its future performance—ultimately leading to the accumulation of wealth. It has been 26 years since he bought his first stock. That experience taught him that there is indeed a wealth of opportunity in books and that knowledge possesses endless potential for application.

At the start of his career, he was not entirely satisfied with simply investing in securities. He always wanted to build companies. This led him to venture investing, where he helped several startups grow from zero to one, watching them expand and flourish. This was yet another fascinating chapter in his journey.

He has witnessed a transformation in China that is nothing short of extraordinary. Over the past 40 years, since the country embraced its reform and opening-up policy, he has seen a nation of 1.4 billion people undergo a metamorphosis unparalleled in recorded history. What was once unimaginable has become reality. From his early days navigating a foreign land 26 years ago to establishing his own investment firm, he has watched his fund grow from a modest few million USD to nearly USD10 billion, delivering returns that have tripled the market average over the same period.

Through his business ventures, he has had a front-row seat to the explosive expansion of global knowledge, witnessing how this unprecedented surge of innovation and ideas has reshaped industries and created immense value across the world. It has been like standing beside the great poets and thinkers of history, observing how this torrent of intellectual advancement has unfolded before his eyes, leaving an indelible mark on the course of human progress.

What’s fascinating is that, within his intellectual framework, China—and its role in the world—has always been central. Historically, China was a remarkably successful civilization, so why did it falter so dramatically in the age of modernization? And what does the future hold for this ancient nation? Jared Diamond’s Guns, Germs, and Steel, published in 1997, tackled the question of how Europeans managed to colonize the Americas so swiftly—a phenomenon with profound and far-reaching consequences for human history. In 2010, Ian Morris’s Why the West Rules—For Now compared the progress of Western and Eastern civilizations over tens of thousands of years. The following year, David Deutsch’s The Beginning of Infinity explored the transformative impact of scientific knowledge and revolutions on human society and the universe. And in 2012, E.O. Wilson’s The Social Conquest of Earth sought to explain human civilization through the lens of biology and evolution.

While these monumental works use a universal perspective to address the issues they care about, they still largely revolve around the West, with China often relegated to the background. Nonetheless, they offered him valuable insights, helping to shape his own understanding and framework for thinking about China. Since 2004, he has had dinner with Munger nearly every week—a tradition that has continued for 15 years. These conversations and exchanges of ideas have had an enormous impact on him.

Around 2010, the core concepts that would eventually crystallize in this book began to take shape. He has always been someone who enjoys revisiting and contemplating complex issues, refining his thoughts over time until he can articulate them clearly and precisely. Yet, the idea of sharing these insights on a broader platform never really interested him, and he has never seen himself as particularly skilled in that arena.

In the pages that follow, he examines human civilization and its evolutionary progress, viewing modernization as the third great leap in human history. He frames China’s modernization as an integral part of humanity’s transition from agricultural civilization to one defined by science and technology. From this vantage point, he explores China’s trajectory over the past 200 years and the transformative changes of the last four decades.

According to him, understanding human civilization and history is crucial for successful investing. The essence of investing lies in predicting the future. To invest in a particular country or company, one must have a deep grasp of the fundamental knowledge of that country, as well as insights into its history and future trends. This becomes especially vital during times of financial crisis. For example, in 2008 and 2009, if you couldn’t quickly assess the fundamentals of the United States, it would have been nearly impossible to make substantial bets as the U.S. stock market plummeted, even if you were focusing on just a single company. The same principle applies to China. When China encounters various challenges, without a fundamental understanding of the country’s developmental trajectory over the next few decades, making sound investment decisions becomes extremely difficult.

The second part of this book builds upon the framework established in the first part, delving into specific, practical issues such as how to interpret China’s 40 years of market reforms and forecast its future potential, whether value investing principles are applicable in China, and if so, how to implement them. It also explores the differing developmental paths taken by the West and East, and how cultural differences shape their interactions. Over the past two decades, he has invested in both China and the United States, and this book reflects his practical experiences and knowledge gained along the way.

His personal journey in acquiring knowledge has made him increasingly optimistic. He draws his definition of optimism from David Deutsch, who argued that “all evils are due to a lack of knowledge.” In other words, with sufficient knowledge, human societies can overcome any adversity and continue to progress.

Since his youth, he has sought two things: truth and meaning. Over time, he came to realize that they are intertwined—truth is meaning. He believes that the purpose of life is to pursue truth, and in doing so, enable individuals, society, and the world to become richer, fairer, more advanced, and more beautiful. Truth, in his view, doesn’t mean absolute certainty, as achieving 100% truth is impossible. What matters is having enough truth that is practical—truth that can be consistently verified, disproven, revised, improved, and refined. A successful society must foster a culture that is forgiving, critical, and tolerant of mistakes, allowing truth to exist, evolve, and progress. A meritocratic system, in his opinion, is essential for fully realizing human productivity, value creation, and collective creativity. This is the meaning he finds in life.
