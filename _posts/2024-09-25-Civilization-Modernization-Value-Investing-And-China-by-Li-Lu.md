In the Preface, the author describes his early fascination with contemplating all kinds of problems. He was drawn to Physics and Mathematics (especially Trigonometry) for their ability to explain the complex world using simple formulas and language. During the open exam for high school students in China, his sole aspiration was to be accepted into a Physics program in college.

When he first encountered the Second Law of Thermodynamics, which states that entropy always increases, he was struck by a profound sense of loneliness and despair. The notion that energy inevitably dissipates into disorder and decay made him question the purpose of existence. If the universe is destined for chaos and the end of life, what is the meaning of it all? What makes his life meaningful?

Karl Popper’s scientific theories had a profound impact on him. While science alone cannot answer questions of meaning, Scientific Philosophy—rooted in scientific principles—might offer some insights. Using science to understand the world and the relationship between individuals and society opened up a new realm of exploration for him. At the time, he was preoccupied with a question that had haunted Chinese intellectuals for over a century: Why is the West leading the world? Why has China lagged so far behind? And, most crucially, can China catch up, and if so, how?

He arrived in the United States in the late 1980s and began his academic journey at Columbia University. The Core Curriculum required all students to engage deeply with the foundations of Western Civilization, studying over a hundred classic works spanning several thousand years, including The Iliad, Greek Philosophy and Drama, Medieval Philosophy, the Renaissance, the Enlightenment, and the Modern Scientific Revolution. This period sparked an immense passion and curiosity in him, igniting a lifelong quest for knowledge. Columbia also offered alternative courses on Confucian Civilization and Islamic Civilization, which allowed him to revisit Chinese history, albeit through the lens of the English language. These formative years at Columbia were crucial in shaping his intellectual framework.

He had always been a seeker of knowledge, but at the time, he had no clear sense of what kind of knowledge could change his own fate or impact society. Then he stumbled upon a lecture by Warren Buffett and realized that through hard work and diligent research, one could analyze a company’s fundamentals, gain insights, and predict its future performance—ultimately leading to the accumulation of wealth. It has been 26 years since he bought his first stock. That experience taught him that there is indeed a wealth of opportunity in books and that knowledge possesses endless potential for application.

At the start of his career, he was not entirely satisfied with simply investing in securities. He always wanted to build companies. This led him to venture investing, where he helped several startups grow from zero to one, watching them expand and flourish. This was yet another fascinating chapter in his journey.

He has witnessed a transformation in China that is nothing short of extraordinary. Over the past 40 years, since the country embraced its reform and opening-up policy, he has seen a nation of 1.4 billion people undergo a metamorphosis unparalleled in recorded history. What was once unimaginable has become reality. From his early days navigating a foreign land 26 years ago to establishing his own investment firm, he has watched his fund grow from a modest few million USD to nearly USD10 billion, delivering returns that have tripled the market average over the same period.

Through his business ventures, he has had a front-row seat to the explosive expansion of global knowledge, witnessing how this unprecedented surge of innovation and ideas has reshaped industries and created immense value across the world. It has been like standing beside the great poets and thinkers of history, observing how this torrent of intellectual advancement has unfolded before his eyes, leaving an indelible mark on the course of human progress.

What’s fascinating is that, within his intellectual framework, China—and its role in the world—has always been central. Historically, China was a remarkably successful civilization, so why did it falter so dramatically in the age of modernization? And what does the future hold for this ancient nation? Jared Diamond’s Guns, Germs, and Steel, published in 1997, tackled the question of how Europeans managed to colonize the Americas so swiftly—a phenomenon with profound and far-reaching consequences for human history. In 2010, Ian Morris’s Why the West Rules—For Now compared the progress of Western and Eastern civilizations over tens of thousands of years. The following year, David Deutsch’s The Beginning of Infinity explored the transformative impact of scientific knowledge and revolutions on human society and the universe. And in 2012, E.O. Wilson’s The Social Conquest of Earth sought to explain human civilization through the lens of biology and evolution.

While these monumental works use a universal perspective to address the issues they care about, they still largely revolve around the West, with China often relegated to the background. Nonetheless, they offered him valuable insights, helping to shape his own understanding and framework for thinking about China. Since 2004, he has had dinner with Munger nearly every week—a tradition that has continued for 15 years. These conversations and exchanges of ideas have had an enormous impact on him.

Around 2010, the core concepts that would eventually crystallize in this book began to take shape. He has always been someone who enjoys revisiting and contemplating complex issues, refining his thoughts over time until he can articulate them clearly and precisely. Yet, the idea of sharing these insights on a broader platform never really interested him, and he has never seen himself as particularly skilled in that arena.

In the pages that follow, he examines human civilization and its evolutionary progress, viewing modernization as the third great leap in human history. He frames China’s modernization as an integral part of humanity’s transition from agricultural civilization to one defined by science and technology. From this vantage point, he explores China’s trajectory over the past 200 years and the transformative changes of the last four decades.

According to him, understanding human civilization and history is crucial for successful investing. The essence of investing lies in predicting the future. To invest in a particular country or company, one must have a deep grasp of the fundamental knowledge of that country, as well as insights into its history and future trends. This becomes especially vital during times of financial crisis. For example, in 2008 and 2009, if you couldn’t quickly assess the fundamentals of the United States, it would have been nearly impossible to make substantial bets as the U.S. stock market plummeted, even if you were focusing on just a single company. The same principle applies to China. When China encounters various challenges, without a fundamental understanding of the country’s developmental trajectory over the next few decades, making sound investment decisions becomes extremely difficult.

The second part of this book builds upon the framework established in the first part, delving into specific, practical issues such as how to interpret China’s 40 years of market reforms and forecast its future potential, whether value investing principles are applicable in China, and if so, how to implement them. It also explores the differing developmental paths taken by the West and East, and how cultural differences shape their interactions. Over the past two decades, he has invested in both China and the United States, and this book reflects his practical experiences and knowledge gained along the way.

His personal journey in acquiring knowledge has made him increasingly optimistic. He draws his definition of optimism from David Deutsch, who argued that “all evils are due to a lack of knowledge.” In other words, with sufficient knowledge, human societies can overcome any adversity and continue to progress.

Since his youth, he has sought two things: truth and meaning. Over time, he came to realize that they are intertwined—truth is meaning. He believes that the purpose of life is to pursue truth, and in doing so, enable individuals, society, and the world to become richer, fairer, more advanced, and more beautiful. Truth, in his view, doesn’t mean absolute certainty, as achieving 100% truth is impossible. What matters is having enough truth that is practical—truth that can be consistently verified, disproven, revised, improved, and refined. A successful society must foster a culture that is forgiving, critical, and tolerant of mistakes, allowing truth to exist, evolve, and progress. A meritocratic system, in his opinion, is essential for fully realizing human productivity, value creation, and collective creativity. This is the meaning he finds in life.

### Value Investing and China

**Investing as a Journey of Self-Discovery
–	Edited Interview with Graham&Doddsville Magazine of Columbia Business School, March 2013**

>How to be a good investor

Part of the game of investing is to **come into your own**. You must find some way that perfectly fits your personality. It's a competitive game and you will run into a lot of very intelligent, hardworking fellows.

The game of investing is a process of discovering:
1. Who you are?
2. What are you interested in?
3. What are you good at?
4. What do you love to do?
then magnifying that until you gain a **sizable edge** over all the other people.

Investing is about predicting the future, and the future is **inherently unpredictable**. Therefore the only way you can do it better is to assess all the facts and *truly know* what you know and what you don't know.

>Where do you find investment ideas?

Ideas come to me from all sources, principally from reading and talking. I don’t discriminate how they come, as long as they are good ideas. You can recognize good ideas by reading a great deal and also by studying a lot of companies and constantly learning from intelligent people – hopefully more intelligent than you are, especially in their field.

>How do you assess management of a corporation?

If you can’t assess the quality of management, you may have to make a decision in spite of that. That’s just part of the process. So you have to figure out other ways such as looking at the quality of the business, the valuation, or something else until you can justify an investment. If you do have a way to assess the quality of the management team, either because you’re an astute student of human psychology, or you have a special relationship with the people, then you’ll take that into consideration. Why wouldn’t you? The management team is part of what really makes a company.

>How do you allocate between US and foreign countries?

You start out by holding cash, and that is a pretty good opportunity cost, because it doesn’t go down. So any time you find an investment, it has to be an improvement on an overall risk -adjusted basis. You may find some very interesting things, and now you’ve got a basket of a few interesting securities plus cash. That is a pretty good opportunity cost, and the next time you add another security, it better make the portfolio better than the existing one. You just constantly improve your opportunity cost.

>How do you define your circle of competence?

I let my own personal interests define my circle of competence. But over time, if you are interested in businesses in addition to securities, you begin to become a student of businesses. Eventually, one thing leads to another and you begin to learn different businesses. You learn the DNAs of businesses, how they progress, and why they are so strong. Over time, I really fell in love with strong businesses. I morphed into finding strong businesses at bargain prices.

>On BYD

I don’t think that Warren and Charlie are ideological. Neither am I. It’s really how much you know. The story of BYD is relatively simple. This guy, who is a really terrific engineer, started the business from just a $300,000 loan with no additional money until the IPO. He created a company with $8 billion in revenue and 170,000 employees and tens of thousands of engineers. He solved a whole bunch of different problems.

They play in a big field with open-ended possibilities and have a reasonable chance of being successful.This company is a learning machine. They are in a market where every single international major brand is competing, with an all-out effort, because it’s such a big market. So they never had any home advantage whatsoever because China’s auto market started out completely open with everybody competing. Yet there’s a little car company with very little money, and, in less than 10 years, it’s selling more than half a million cars a year and has carved out a position for itself. You have to say, the record is not too bad, and so there’s something to it. They also have an engineering culture and a can-do spirit. They consistently demonstrate that they’re able to tackle really complex engineering problems and come up with very practical solutions faster, cheaper, and better than most other people. That is an advantage in the manufacturing economy.

> On investing in technology stokcs

Most businesses are subject to change if you stay with them long enough. There’s not a single business that I know of that will never change. That’s the fascinating thing about business. Successful technology companies are the ones that are capable of reinventing themselves and dealing with change.

Take Samsung – their early memory chip business decreased in price by 1% every week, and yet they really developed a culture that precisely deals with that change. So when they apply the same culture to something like a cell phone, they get ahead very quickly. Now they’re outselling Apple. So culture really plays an important role in those faster-changing environments, enabling certain companies to always surge ahead of everybody else.

It certainly is a plus, but not a must. If you were really a great engineer in the product the business is selling, obviously it’s a plus. But it’s certainly not a must because no matter how good you are at a certain area, you’re not so good in other areas. The pace of change is such that whatever you are now specialized in will become obsolete. But that doesn’t disqualify you from making a judgment on how a company can develop a culture to deal with that. 

I think you want to avoid wrong decisions as much or more than you want to get it approximately right. If you avoid the wrong decisions, you’ll probably come out okay over time. But, I agree with you, it’s not easy and it’s not precise or a science at all. Hopefully one improves overtime.

>Compensation structure in the Investment Management business

My ambition has never been to run the largest fund. I never wanted to earn the most money out of a fund. I just wanted to have, by the time I finished my career, one of the best track records on a risk -adjusted basis. If I achieve that, I will feel very good about myself. That’s my goal, and therefore the compensation structure of the fund reflects that. 

Over time, I switched into the best compensation structure I knew in the industry, the original “Buffett partnership formula”. We don’t take any management fee. We provide a 6% return for free to our investors and then take 25% after that. I don’t invest anything outside of the fund. I put all of my investment capital into my funds. So it’s a true partnership.

The minute that new money arrives, it begins to compound 6% on an annual basis against me, so I better be able to find something that is worthwhile and doing better. When I make money, I feel like I earn it, and when my investors make money, they earn it. It is just a better way to structure a business – you feel that everybody’s success is deserved.

>On Selling

One should make sell decisions on one of three occasions:
1. If you make a mistake: Investing is a probability game. Let’s say you go into a situation with 90% confidence that things will work out one way and a 10% chance they work out another way, and that 10% event happens. You sell it.Then there’s a mistake that your analysis is completely wrong. You thought it was 99% one way but it was actually 99% the other way. When you realize that, sell as fast as you can.
2. When the valuation swings way too much to the other end of the extreme: If you are right and hold a company for a long time, you have accumulated a large amount of unrealized gains. A big portion of those unrealized gains act like borrowings from the government interest free and legally. So when you sell that position, you take all the leverage and you take a bunch of the capital out, so your return on equity has just become a little less.
3. When you find something that is better: Essentially, a portfolio as I said is opportunity cost. Your job as a portfolio manager is to constantly improve on your basket. You start with a high bar. You want to increase the bar higher and higher. You do that by constantly improving the opportunity costs; you find something better.

>On Shorting

There are three reaons that make shorting a miserable business:
1. Limited upside and unlimited downside.
2. Fraud takes time to uncover, short borrows can bankrupt your bank roll.
3. Messes up your mental state
4. Economy grew consistently for 200-300 years, economic growth is naturally in favor of longs in terms of odds

>On Financial Crisis

**Intellectual Honesty** is the most important virtue in the investment management industry. You have to be extremely clear about:
1. What you know
2. What you don't know
3. What you dont' need to know
4. Unknown unknowns

**Intelligent Investor** can distintly know whether they know or they dont' know, and now what they don't have to know, and that there exist unknown unknowns.

Christopher Davis’s grandfather used to say that *"You make the most money out of a bear market financial panic – you just don’t know it at the time."* It’s always the case.

>On China

The importance of China cannot be ignored.
China is so big. It has all sorts of extreme phenomena. If you go through the American Civil War, the country killed two percent of its population. And yet, not only was it rebuilt, but it was rebuilt at a furious pace. And it went through two great world wars. After World War II, if you thought Japan and Germany were doomed, boy were you wrong.

>Recommendations for those interested in Investment Management

Start by learning from the best – **listening, studying, and reading**. But the most important thing in understanding the investment business is by doing it. There is no substitute to actually doing it. The best way to do it is to study one business inside and out for the purpose of making the investment – you may not actually invest. But having gone through the discipline of understanding one business as if you own 100% of that business is very valuable. 

To start, take an easy -to - understand business. It could be a tiny business – a little concession store, a restaurant, or a small publicly traded company. It doesn’t matter. Understand one business and what really makes it tick:
1. How it makes money
2. How it organizes its finances
3. How management makes its decisions
4. How it compares to the competition
5. How it adjusts to the environment
6. How it invests extra cash
7. How it finances the business

You should understand every aspect of one business as if you own 100% but you don’t actually run it. This causes you to be desperate to understand every aspect to protect your investment. That will give you a sense of a **disciplined approach**. That’s how you truly understand business and investing.

Warren always says that to be a good investor, you need to be a good businessman, and to be a good businessman, you need to be a **good investor in terms of capital allocation**.

Start by **understanding one thing within your control** that you can understand **inside and out**. That is a terrific starting point. If you start from that basis, you are fundamentally in the right direction of becoming a great security analyst.

**Investor, Speculator and the Markets
–	Keynote Address at the Harvard Business School Investment Conference, March 24, 2018**

After coming across Warren Buffett's lecture on investing, he spent one whole year studying Warren Buffett, Charlie Munger and Berkshire Hathaway. After that he bought his first stock using borrowed money. In the past 25-26 years, a switch in career has never crossed his mind.

>What is a stock market?


It’s a system that pools together the capital of small savers, creating a virtuous cycle through the design of the markets. When a corporation reports strong earnings, it benefits small savers who often wear multiple hats as employees, shareholders, and consumers. As employees, their wages increase; as savers, their wealth grows; and as consumers, they spend more on products and services produced by these very corporations. This, in turn, channels more capital back into the businesses, fueling further growth. When this dynamic unfolds on a large scale, it contributes to the overall prosperity of society. That’s the fundamental essence of markets.

The major issue with the stock market is that most small savers don’t know how to accurately price stocks. When a corporation fails, stock prices drop, exposing small savers to significant inherent risks. For the positive reinforcement loop to function and create a win-win situation, certain conditions must be met—a **critical mass** must be reached. This means that the majority of small savers and corporations need to actively participate in the exchange system for these beneficial effects to materialize. This has been true throughout the history of stock market development.

How did this come about? One defining feature of the stock market is that anyone who is allowed to buy is also allowed to sell. This aligns with human nature. Laziness, greed, and speculation are innate human instincts. If there’s an opportunity to gain more than what we’ve invested, we’re likely to take it. The stock market embodies this principle, and because of its alignment with human behavior, it draws more and more participants, creating a positive feedback loop.

Most stock markets experience bubbles, so why have they stood the test of time? The answer lies in one crucial element: the presence of genuine savers who are willing to invest in growing enterprises. There are real, high-quality companies that need capital to expand. Once the number of these savers and enterprises reaches a critical mass, the market becomes efficient.

The stock market is driven by two major forces:
1. Investors who support companies at fair prices, providing them with the capital needed for sustainable growth.
2. Speculators who engage in short-term trading to make quick profits. This is the primary reason the stock market attracts so many participants. The interaction of supply and demand among all these players determines transaction prices.

The coexistence of these two forces—long-term investors and short-term speculators—helps create a dynamic and resilient market ecosystem.

The quantitative trading camp and many of the most successful hedge fund managers employ thousands of mathematicians and physicists, even Nobel Prize Winners —yet not a single one of them can read a financial statement. This is what they call the Efficient Market Theory! In reality, short-term stock movements behave in a manner completely opposite to traditional economic theory. For example, in economics, when the price of a product increases, demand typically decreases; when the price falls, demand rises. But in the stock market, the opposite occurs: as stock prices rise, people buy more, and the faster prices climb, the more they buy. Conversely, when stock prices fall, everyone rushes to sell, and the deeper the market declines, the quicker the selling accelerates.

In my 26 years of investing, I have never witnessed the market efficiently pricing the few companies I am deeply familiar with. Although fundamental investors represent a minority in terms of numbers and capital, they ultimately serve as the final arbiters of price. In the long run, the stock market is a weighing machine, and the true process of price discovery must be driven by fundamental investors, even though it is a lengthy journey. Only through fundamental investing can the market continue to fulfill its role in price discovery over the long term.

At the same time, only with the existence of a reasonable price discovery mechanism can a market continue to grow. When a market reaches critical mass, listed companies will be able to represent the key players within the economic system, making index fund investing a viable option.

In a modern economic system, compound growth can occur steadily over several centuries. For a stock market that has reached critical mass, the returns of index funds reflect the average stock investment returns within that economic system. Over the long term, these returns will mirror the compound growth of the economy’s GDP. While index funds may appear to be simple transaction vehicles, they rely fundamentally on the presence of active, fundamental investors. Without them, the market lacks an economic foundation for its existence and cannot achieve sustainable growth. Consequently, index investing would not be viable in the long run without the stabilizing force of fundamental investors.
