In the Acknowledgements section, the author read the book *The Selfish Gene* by Richard Dawkins, recommended by Charlie Munger in 2000 and his life hasn't been the same since. The book is broken down into 3 sections:
1. Avoid Big Risks
2. Buy High Quality at a Fair Price
3. Don't be lazy - be *very* lazy

## Avoid Big Risks

>In Chapter 1, the author discussed how **"betting your life"** is a remarkably sound strategy for investing and how adopting this approach has led to the spectacular success of *all* living organisms over millions of years.

Type I error: do things we are not supposed to do, e.g. make a bad investment because I erroneously think it is a good one. Harm themselves.

Type II error: don't do things we are supposed to do, e.g. reject a good investment because I erroneously think it is bad. Walk away from a great opportunity.

*The risk of these two errors is inversely related.*

An overly optimistic investor who sees an upside in almost every investment will make several type I errors by committing to bad investments but also will not miss out on the few good investments.

On the other hand, an overly cautious investor who keeps finding reasons to reject every investment is likely to make very few bad investments but will lose out on some good investments

Which of the following investment strategies should you use:
1. making a lot of investments so as not to lose out on some good opportunities, as a result living with some failed investments
2. being highly selective to avoid making bad investments, thereby missing out on some good investments

Hints from evolution:

Stags found great evolutionary success by minimiing self-harm, not even attempt to duel until they have big enough antlers, refuse to engage until they believe they have more than a fair chance of winning. Only about 5% of rutting stags receive permanent injuries.

The deer make many more type II errors such as withdrawing from a rutting duel when they have a good chance of winning the harem. Lost opportunity to mate.

Plants commit resources to defending against attacks or growing. Indirect defense works on the simple principle that "my enemy's enemy is my friend".

When a plant senses an insect attack, it releases chemical compounds that attract predators of the insects attacking the plants.

Plants avoid taking risks to their life and well-being at the cost of giving up potentially juicy opportunities.

Buffett's Two Rules of Investing
1. Never lose money: don't commit to an investment in which the *probability* of losing money is higher than the probability of making money. *Risk* should be the probability of incurring a capital loss.
2. Never forget rule number 1

**A Great Investor Is a Great Rejector**

***There are very few good investments in the market.***

Minimizing Type I errors increases Success Rate much more dramatically than minimizing Type II errors, simple because there are few good investments.

**How to avoid Big Risks**
1. Be wary of Criminals, Crooks, and Cheats
2. Avoid Turnarounds: recommends IBM, Lou Gerstner's book *Who Says Elephants Can't Dance? Inside IBM's Historic Turnaround*, CEO of IBM from 1993 to 2002, stock price went up 7x from $13 to $77. Ron Johnson, credited with transforming Target and creating the iconic Apple Stores, took over JCPenny, sales dropped 25%, stock price dropped 60% during his 18 months tenure before being fired by the board in mid-2013. Predicting the fate of turnaroudn efforts even at what *appeared* at slam-dunk cases don't seem so clear cut.
3. Detesting Debt: If a company can borrow money to purchase assets, its return on equity and earnings per share should improve. Mathematically, this is undoubtedly true. Realistically, this is undoubtedly dangerous.
>What could be more important than improving short-term return on equity and earnings per share for a business:
>1. Survival. There is no point in improving return on equity by a few % if it compromises long-term survival. The 20 biggest bankruptcies in the United States, *all*, were heavily indebted. More than 90% of Nalanda's portfolio companies have excess cash and *no* leverage. Only 3 out of 30 have some debt, and the maximum debt/equity ratio among the three is 0.3.
>2. **Debt diminishes strategic flexibility and hence long-term value creation.**
4. Ignoring M&A Junkies: AOL an Time Warner, $350 billion merger in 2000. Within 2 years, AOL took a write-off of $99 *billion* on the deal and market value went from $226 billion in 2000 to $20 billion in 2002, acquired by Verizon for $4.4 billion in 2015. *Harvard Business Review* article by Clyton Christensen and others titled "The Big Idea: The New M&A Playbook" claims that 70 to 90% of M&A fail; KPMG study claims that 83% of merger deals did not create value. Reasons for failure include culture mismatch, overpayment, misevaluation of the opportunity, external factors, and integration problems, among many others. Singple biggest reason Nalanda detest M&A: **opportunity cost**
>What Bayer missed doing by making a gargantuan acquisition of Monsanto:
>1. divestiture of attractive business
>2. reduced focus on existing businesses
>3. missed opportunities
5. Not Predicting Where the Puck Will be: 546 IPOs successfully raised $69 billion in 1999 alone but *very* few companies have created truly significant value from the dot-com era, such as Amazon, Google, eBay and Priceline (now called Booking Holdings).
6. Not Aligning with Unaligned Owners: Nalanda want the company owner to align their interest with the shareholders'. one and only one objective as a shareholder of any business is **long-term value creation**. The company must do this in an ethical, sustainable manner that is fair to all stakeholders, including employees, vendors, suppliers, and customers.
>Three broad categories of owners that Nalanda avoid to mitigate Type I risk:
>1. Government-owned businesses: The government wants to achieve multiple objectives with their businesses, some of which have nothing to do with enhancing value and profits. The skill required to run a company successfully in a competitive environment is not the same as that needed to manage a district or devise a sound social policy for a state.
>2. Listed subsidiaries of global giants: they are more interested in the value creation of the *parent*, not the Indian-listed child. Best managers in MNCs are sent tto the privately held *separate* fully owned subsidiary, not the listed subsidiary that the Indian government forced them to list.
>3. Indian conglomerates: value creation is possible only through sustained focus. How does one achieve excellence in multiple entities across entirely different industries?

**At Nalanda, shortlist comprises 75 to 80 companies out of a universe of about 800 with a market value of more than $100 million.**

## Buy High Quality at a Fair Price

*An economic franchise arises from a product or service that (1) is needed or desired; (2) is thought by its customers to have no close substitute; and (3) is not subject to price regulation. The existence of all three conditions will be demonstrated by a company's ability to regularly price its product or service aggressively and thereby to earn high rates of return on capital. Moreoever, franchises can tolerate mismanagement. Inept managers may diminish a franchise's profitability, but they cannot inflict mortal damage.* - Warren Buffett, 1991

Two-step approach at Nalanda:
1. use *one* selection criterion that filters out low-quality or average-quality businesses and yields a premliminary list of high-quality companies.
2. Do more work on this preliminary list to further whittle it down to a final list.

>Investable universe: 800 Indian businesses (with a market value of more than $150 million)
>Reject close to 350 companies to minimize the risks outlined in Section 1.
>About 450 businesses remain. Then apply a *single* filter "F" to cut down this list to about 150 firms.
>F simply gives the preliminary list on which work needs to be done to further reject or choose businesses.
>Final list has only about 75 to 80 businesses.

What is F?
1. It should be easily measurable
2. It should remove most, if not all, low-quality businesses
3. It should select most, if not all, high-quality businesses

Guesses for F:
1. Management: when someone says, "This is a great management team," what they are *actually* saying is, "These guys talk so well!" The "great management team" filter fails the first criterion of measurability (being easily measurable)
2. Revenue growth: problem is how do we know what went *into* achieving this growth? most internet businesses were growing fast during the dot-com bust. They ignored the cost of growth and suffered for it.
3. Margins: Gross margin doesn't tell us anythign about the *quality* of business. EBITDA or EBIT margin can't distinguish a good business Costco (3% operating margin) vs Tiffany & Co. (19% operating margin) and fails to filter fo the second *and* third criteria.
4. Macro factors: if inflation is picked as the macro factor, do you compeltely revise the list if the inflation expectations get reversed wtihin 6 months?

Dmitri Belyaev wanted to answer 2 questions:
1. How had the domestication of animals (e.g., dogs, pigs, goats, and cows) started, and
2. Why did most domestic animals have similar characteristics, including floppy ears, curly tails, a piebald coloration (patches of black and white), and babyish faces?

>***What was being selected?***

Dmitri hypothecized that the key facor selected when our ancestors domesticated wild animals was *tameness*. Lyudmila Trut bred wild foxes by selecting a few of the calmest Class I (friendliest and seemed to want to engage with the handlers) foxes for mating. The 8th generation started displaying novel *physical* traits in coat color with a piebald pattern, floppy ears and rolled tails. Lyudmila lived with a fox and it starts showing guard-dog-like behavior, rushing to protect a human from a potential threat.

This single filter of a *behavioral* characteristic had triggered many *physical* changes in the animals. How could this have happened?

When a dog owner stares lovingly into their canine's eyes, oxytocin is released int he systems of both the dog and the owner, creating a positive feedback loop in whcih the two enjoy each other's company more and more. Although it's the same gene in question, the gene expression is different in different situations. Scientists have demonstrated that gene expression needs to change only a little to have a significant impact on an animal's body and behavior.

Lyudmila's selection of tamer foxes alttered the amount and timing of release of certain neurochemicals and hormones that regulated the developmental and physical traits of the foxes.

>***Darwin predicted that if humans choose to select for one characteristic, they will surely also cause transformations in other characteristics owing to what he called the "mysterious laws of the correlation of growth".***

**At Nalanda, they *begin* with *historical* return on capital employed (ROCE) while short-listing businesses.**

**ROCE = EBIT / (Net Working Capital + Net Fixed Assets)**

Exclude excess cash (i.e., cash minus debt if cash happens to be much greater than debt) in Net Working Capital because extra cash is not an operating asset.

For an acquisitive company, include the capital invested in acquiring businesses.

The advantage of measuring ROCE is that it accounts for the quality of P&L (in the numerator) as well as the balance sheet (in the denominator).

***A Consistently High-ROCE Business Is Likely to Be Run by an Excellent Management Team***
